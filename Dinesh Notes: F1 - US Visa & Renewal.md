Rastriya Parichaya Patra: https://citizenportal.donidcr.gov.np/en/check-nid-card-status 
NID card Nepal: https://enrollment.donidcr.gov.np/PreEnrollment/ 
 - print after submitting form and getting appointment (Durbargmarg NID for many provinces including Lumbini). This print has a QR code at the bottom right.
 - Take that printed copy and original citizenship to the office on the day of appointment. The appointment is for 1 hour, try to reach 10 mintues before (doesn't matter as long as you are reach within appointment slot).
 - Photo and biometrics will be taken. Then you will get a document with a NIN number and a card later on. That number alone is enough for other administrative processes like passport renewal ... 


 Passport renewal: 
 - https://emrtds.nepalpassport.gov.np/request-service
 -  appointment slots are open after 5 PM everyday for nextday.
 -  book a slot (date of next day and time slot) and then fill up the form with details from Nagarikta, NID, previous passport, and basic information.
 -  Print the form after completion. Note reference ID.
 -  Pay amount using esewa, connectips, khalti and so on and then download payment voucher. 
 -  Then take completed form and  the payment voucher to the Department of Passport, Tripureshwar along with original citizenship, and previous passport.
 -  There is always a huge line for passport and appointment slot timing doesn't matter so reach as soon as possible and get in the line (gate opens at 11 but I heard people start as early as 4 AM).
 -  Good luck





Interview questions for renewing:

- Q1: Why are you returning to the United States?
 - I am returning to continue my PhD research and complete my degree. I have about three years remaining to finish my project and graduate.

- Q2: What program are you studying and how much is left to finish?
 - I am studying Plant Breeding and Genetics in the College of Agriculture. My research is ongoing and I expect about three more years before graduation.

- Q3: Why did you choose this university for your PhD?
 - Cornell is a leading institution in my field and offers strong research in plant breeding and quantitative genetics. The faculty and facilities match my research interests. My advisor is highly supportive and his expertise aligns well with my project, so it was a natural choice.

- Q4: Who is funding your PhD and how are your living expenses covered?
 - My PhD is funded through my research lab under my advisor. The lab receives competitive grants from agencies such as NSF and USDA, as well as industry partners. I receive full tuition waiver, health insurance and competitive stipend that covers my living expenses pretty well, so I am fully funded.

- Q5: What is your research about?
 - My research focuses on applying data science, remote sensing and crop modeling to improve agriculture. I use drone-based technology to measure plant traits and understand how crops respond to environment and management. This will in turn help to develop better crop varieties. 

- Q6: What do you plan to do after your PhD?
 - After finishing my PhD, I plan to return to Nepal and work in agricultural research. My goal is to join Nepal Agricultural Research Council so I will start applying there from my final year in PhD. I am planning to introduce satellite based technology (freely available) and data driven modeling to strengthen crop research and breeding programs in Nepal. This is major lacking in Nepalese research sector and I hope I can help to add a few bricks to uplift the level of research in Nepal. 

- Q7: Why do you need to renew your visa instead of finishing from Nepal or remotely?
 - I cannot finish remotely. I have one more year of field research that requires planting, drone flights and data collection on campus during the growing season. My funding also requires that I remain at the university and continue full time research on site.

- Q8: Have you maintained your immigration status and academic standing during your previous stay?
 - Yes. I have maintained my F1 status for the past five years and remained full time every semester. My academic progress is strong. I currently have a 4.0 GPA.

- Q9: Do you have family in the United States?
 - No. My family is in Nepal.

- Q10: What benefits will Nepal get from your training in the United States?
 - Nepal will benefit from advanced research skills in plant breeding, data science and remote sensing. I will bring back experience using drones, satellite data and crop modeling to support agricultural research. These tools are not widely used in Nepal, so they can help improve crop improvement programs and technology transfer for farmers.

- Q11: How long do you expect to stay in the United States before returning to Nepal?
 - I will stay until I complete my PhD and graduate. After that I will return to Nepal and work in agricultural research. 

- Q12: Why should the United States continue to grant you an F1 visa?
 - I need to complete my research training and degree. I am making good academic progress and my work requires field experiments, drone flights and data analysis on campus. I am fully funded and in good standing with my department and my university, so an extension of my visa allows me to finish my PhD as planned.

- Q13: After studying in the United States, why do you want to return to Nepal instead of staying in the United States?
 - In the United States there are already many experts in plant breeding and data driven agriculture. In Nepal there are very few. My training will have much greater impact at home. Nepal is an agricultural country and our research system needs scientists who can apply modern tools such as remote sensing, modeling and quantitative genetics. I want to contribute to that development and support food security in Nepal. My family and long-term career plans are also in Nepal.

- Q14: What is your advisor’s name and what does your lab do?
 - My advisor is Professor Kelly Robbins. Our lab focuses on quantitative genetics and crop modeling to support plant breeding and improve variety development.

- Q15: Do you have a job offer or active plan in Nepal?
 - I do not have a formal job offer yet, but I have an active plan. I am collaborating with researchers in Nepal and assisting with data analysis for ongoing experiments. My goal is to apply to the Nepal Agricultural Research Council during my final year of PhD and return to work in agricultural research.
