## 2. Fill in details and file an application

- Select options as below:
- " Apply for visa ... "
- Start application
- I want to apply for a : "Visitor visa or super visa"
- Why do you need visa? : "To visit canada as a tourist"
- ### Make sure to select "Tourist option" not for conference.
- The reason is if you select conference, it will ask for much more details later on. Even if you are going for conference, selection tourist option first and then on the details mention about conference that you are visiting and also mention few other tourist places around your conference area that you plan to visit.
- Get details of the conference. Even if you don't have one, just google and find out one that suites your research area.
- Tell us more about what you will do: My answer was, don't copy this exact same, get idea and make your own.
   - I will be attending conference.
   - And visit Toronto
   - Royal famour Ontario Museum
   - CN tower in Toronto
   - Niagara falls
- Are you applying on behalf of someone else? NO (if you are doing on your own)
- Then Travel document: select passport and regular (normally)
- Non immigrant visa number is in your passport visa stamp page starts usually with some letter and is in right side just below expiration date (usually in Red letters) - 8 digits (For Nepalese visa)
- Give detials on natioanl identity document - If you have one, provide that. I didn't so I provided citizenship details.
- Contact information and mailing address where you are currently.
- Finance option: At least $3000 usd ( I showed $ 5000k). Will explain later but i showed a bank statement of that amount in the bank.
- Fill up all the information on eduction, work and other activities. I copied mostly from my CV.
- Provide travel history.
- Details on your parents ( their current address/permanent address). For me, it was from Nepal.
- Documents upload: I uploaded 
   - US non-immigrant visa 
   - National identity document/citizenship (Nepalese) 
   - Passport/travel document 
   - Additional documents: Attach a finance details document explaining your financial situation. I mean how much is the estimated cost associated with your travel and how mich you have in your bank for visiting. You can also mention major registration and hotel cost will be paid by your lab/university. But I said I will pay for everything and that's why included a snapshot of $5000 usd in this document file.
- At last, pay the biometris and visitor visa fee of CAN$85 and 100 each = CAN$185 (in octorber of 2024) and sign consent and submit.
- Just wait for the decision.

## 3. Wait for approval and email/letter requesting for biometrics. 

- Once you receive that letter,  Go to your biometrics location whereever is feasible.
- You just have to login to your IRCC and follow the prompt provided to selct location and book an appointment
- Make sure to take passport, appointment confirmation letter and letter with reference number :
  - ALWAYS REMEMBER YOUR ### REFERENCE NUMBER ### WHICH STARTS WITH CAN and then 9 numbers
- A heads up that i was not aware up until later is that if you can give biometrics in Manhattan, NY location, you won't have to pay courier service fee later on which is equivalent to around $80 usd.
- Give your biometrics and then just wait for the decision.

## GOOD LUCK

- The main idea is to send your passport either :

   - Or your own fedex one. (cheaper but may be less reliable) 
- Start from this website and select which website to use (USA or UK or ...)
