Rastriya Parichaya Patra: https://citizenportal.donidcr.gov.np/en/check-nid-card-status 
NID card Nepal: https://enrollment.donidcr.gov.np/PreEnrollment/ 
 - print after submitting form and getting appointment (Durbargmarg NID for many provinces including Lumbini). This print has a QR code at the bottom right.
 - Take that printed copy and original citizenship to the office on the day of appointment. The appointment is for 1 hour, try to reach 10 mintues before (doesn't matter as long as you are reach within appointment slot).
 - Photo and biometrics will be taken. Then you will get a document with a NIN number and a card later on. That number alone is enough for other administrative processes like passport renewal ... 


 Passport renewal: 
 - https://emrtds.nepalpassport.gov.np/request-service
 -  appointment slots are open after 5 PM everyday for nextday.
 -  book a slot (date of next day and time slot) and then fill up the form with details from Nagarikta, NID, previous passport, and basic information.
 -  Print the form after completion. Note reference ID.
 -  Pay amount using esewa, connectips, khalti and so on and then download payment voucher. 
 -  Then take completed form and  the payment voucher to the Department of Passport, Tripureshwar along with original citizenship, and previous passport.
 -  There is always a huge line for passport and appointment slot timing doesn't matter so reach as soon as possible and get in the line (gate opens at 11 but I heard people start as early as 4 AM).
 -  Good luck
